- Possible threats calculation: 
    - Pawns front diagonals are a threat, but those are not natural movement options for a pawn (only when opponent piece is in place)
    - Potential trading pieces should be a threat to opponent to, i.e. capturing a pawn who's guarded by another pawn

- Add Checked bool flag to player to condition possibleMoves result
