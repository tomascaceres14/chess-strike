NOTES / THOUGHTS

- As of now, pieces don't know their possible moves until they try to move.
Consider each piece saving their attacked squares and legal moves in a field, and re-calculate after each move.

For example:

... move logic ...

player.Attacks = player.AttackedSquares() -> 
                 for each piece, piece.AttackedSquares() ->
                 piece calculates and saves in memory variable.

Same for legal moves and for opponent as well.

This should solve various problems:
1. Faster to detect checkmates
